# Project Title
Psychometric_IQ_Team_Formation
# Project Description
Psychometric test, IQ test and Team Formation App with Python using GUI
# Motivation
We decided to create this app for a university project. Our university is Ionian University Department of Informatics.
# Reason why we build this project
To help students create the best and most efficient teams possible.
# What problem does it solve
It solves the problem of creating teams in group projects.
# What did we learn
Through this app we learnt coding in python, use and create GUI, handle databases with sqlite3, manage with pressure and time and cooperate with each other.
# What makes our project stand out
The fact that it's free, open source and helps students have a better university experience.
# What our application does
Firstly, the user chooses between greek or english language and the order of the tests that he/she will take. Then, the user proceeds to register or login to our app using his/her Ionian University id and get his/her credentials stored to our database. After, he/she takes the tests by the chosen order. The test are IQ testing and Psychometric. The IQ test consists of some mini games fun to take and some general knowledge questions. The psychometric test includes 10 questions that will define the user's team role. Additionally, the user gets asked whether he/she prefers to retake the tests for another user or continue to the team formation. Moreover, there is a showcase of the optimal 3 or 4 user teams constructed. Conclusionally, it displays the usernames ,roles and scores of all users and also the user or users with the highest IQ score.
# What technologies we used and why
We used:
1. python because it was a requirement.
2. sqlite3 for the database handle and because we want a computer stored database in a .db file.
3. hashlib library to hash the password in oreder to be protected from threats.
4. tkinter for the GUI.
5. suprocess because we wanted to use subprograms, make our code easily read and efficient.
6. to check whether a given string matches a given pattern, or contains such a pattern.
# Problems we faced
1. Rookie python users
2. Little time, a lot of things to do
3. Difficulties making the login and register function because we hadn't worked with sql before.
4. Combining fun and efficiency in our app.
# Features we hope to implement in the future
1. Take a research from the students that will use the app and make a more precise result.
2. Combine the results of the IQ and Psychometric test in order to create the teams. Also, consider personal relationships between the users at the team formation.
3. Make a forgot my password function.
4. Addition of more mini games and questions.
5. Addition of music background and timer.
6. More well designed, aesthetic, user friendly GUI.
# How to Install and Run the Project
1. Download pygame - pip install pygame
2. If you use VScode you can install the extension SQLite Viewer in orde to visualize the database.
3. Have in mind that you must have all the files in the same folder.

# How to Contribute to the Project
You can easily contribute to the project by implementing any of the features suggested above or whatever you want and makes the app better.
# Î’ibliography
The biggest part of the project is written by us. Also we found things at GitHub, StackOverFlow, W3schools, GeeksforGeeks and ChatGPT, and then we edited them in order to be used in our app. At the IQ games the tower of Hanoi mini game has been taken from another user of github and the url is: https://github.com/pmellingimenes/TowerHanoi4Python . Also, at the psychometric test the inspiration and the format of the questions was taken from this example website test: https://www.actioned.com/team-member-quiz/. In addition, the way how the role of the user is decided, came up through this pdf file http://www.nursingleadership.org.uk/pubs/BusynurseTeamRoles.pdf .
# Thanks for reading till now
Hope you enjoy the app!!!
